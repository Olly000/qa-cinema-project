# qa-cinema-project
This is a project made for a cinema client who wanted a functional website designed and built. Along with a backend
that would allow them to store information on films and customers and provide a discussion board.
The whole project was built in a node project, the website was built using React, Javascript HTML5 and CSS.  The backend
consisted of express with a MongoDB database.

# Installation
The website and application can be run by cloning or forking this repository then performing the npm start
command whilst in the client and api directories (both are required to utilise the full functionality of the 
website).  

# Dependencies
The dependencies required are detailed in teh package.json files of the respective react and express (api)
directories.  They can be installed locally by using the npm install command once the repository has been
cloned.  Node is required on the local machine in order to perform this.

# Additional Documentation
